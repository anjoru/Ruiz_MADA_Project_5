This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder.

This code should be run after the /R/processing-code/MADAproject_pt2_ruiz.qmd file. 

EDA_unified.qmd is the main is a Quarto file where the all EDA code is housed. 

The archived files folder contains old R scripts that may not be complete or use the most recent datasets.
